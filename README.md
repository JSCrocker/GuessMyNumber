In the first part of the project Guess My Number, I am learning how to manipulate the DOM using "document.querySelector('.message').textContent" and "document.querySelector('.guess').value = 23;".

The second part of the project Guess My Number, using event handler was able to have the user input a number from 1-20 and have the game check the user input vs the random generated number. The condintions for check are the following: 
  1) is there a number, if not then display no number. 
  2) if the number is correct, display You are correct. 
  3) if the number is to high, display number is high and subtract 1 from the Score. 
  4) if the number is to low, display number is low and subtract 1 from the Score. 
  5) if score reaches 0, display you have lost.
  
The third part of the project Guess My Number, using JavaScript to manipulate the CSS. Used "document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#60b347';" to change the backgroud color and       "document.querySelector('.number').style.width = '30rem" to change the sercet number box to be wider when the user guesses the correct number

The fourth part of the project Guess My Number, implemented the Again! button. When pressing the Again! button the game resets to the starting config.

The last item for Guess My Number, implemented the High Score. If the user beats the highscore, their score will become the highscore. Highscore will not reset when the user wants to play again; however, highscore will reset if the page is refreshed.
